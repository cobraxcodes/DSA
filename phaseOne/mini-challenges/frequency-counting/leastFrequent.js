// Mini-Challenge 1: Finding the Least Frequent Element

// Goal: Write a function that takes an array of numbers nums and returns the single number that appears the least number of times. If there's a tie, any one of the tied numbers is fine.
// Hint: You'll still need to count frequencies. How would your sorting logic change, or what would you pick from the sorted list?
// Example: findLeastFrequent([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]) should return 2.
// Example: findLeastFrequent([1, 2, 3, 4]) could return 1, 2, 3, or 4.
