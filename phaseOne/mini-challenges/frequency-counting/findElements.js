// Mini-Challenge 4: Find All Elements with Exactly X Occurrences

// Goal: Write a function that takes an array of numbers nums and a specific targetCount. It should return an array of all distinct numbers that appear exactly targetCount times in nums. The order of the returned numbers doesn't matter.
// Hint: Count frequencies. Then, filter your frequency data based on the value.
// Example: findExactOccurrences([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], 2)
// Frequencies: 1:2, 2:1, 3:3, 4:1
// Result: [1] (because only 1 appears exactly 2 times)
// Example: findExactOccurrences([5, 5, 6, 6, 7], 2) should return [5, 6] (order doesn't matter).
