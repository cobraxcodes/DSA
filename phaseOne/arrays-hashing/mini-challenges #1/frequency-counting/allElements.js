// Mini-Challenge 2: Are All Elements Unique?

// Goal: Write a function that takes an array of numbers nums and returns true if all elements in the array are unique (i.e., no number appears more than once), and false otherwise.
// Hint: You're counting frequencies here too, but you don't need to sort. What condition would tell you if an element is not unique?
// Example: areAllUnique([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return true.
// Example: areAllUnique([1, 2, 3, 2]) should return false.
